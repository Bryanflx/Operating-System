# Operating-System
I have uploaded my OS homework and related documents in the respository, may this will help your study!

# Acknowledgement
Some of my codes are inspired and modified from my friend David Du, and he also helped my a lot in my OS course.

# Courses preparation
Linux and c are required in the courses so get your virtualbox and Ubuntu ready. And don't forget the c compiler gcc in linux.
